# Yoo-Joonghyuk-Flappybird-clone
Hello, I dont know what to write in READMes honestly so im gonna tell about my project briefly. so this is my very first big project that i tried to make after making very basic simple websites... this Yoo Joonghyuk Flappy bird game is basically a flappy bird clone where i replaced the flappy bird and used this character (one of my favourite characters) instead and made the theme apocalypsy instead. i looked for lots of tutorials but it was just so hard so i studied hard and made my own code somehow for the logics merging what i saw on the tutorials+simplifying what i understood.. i also made all assets on my own to match the vibe of the game. i wanted to add a Main Menu too but i just couldnt grasp on HOW DO I DO THAT and i really dont know how to ask for help. I hope its okay as my first ever big project. honestly im terrified i really wanted it to be much much better with a main menu and a high score showing data menu and an instructions menu i even made the assets for that but i dooontt knooww. hopefully any of the mentors can help me to further complete my code. I'll stop talking now. Thank you for reading.
